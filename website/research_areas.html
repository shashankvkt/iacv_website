					<li><h3>Video Surveillance for face recognition</h3></header></li> 
					<p><b>The increasing use of surveillance cameras for addressing security concerns has led to increased demand for robust face (object) recognition systems. The images captured by the surveillance cameras usually have poor resolution, uncontrolled pose and illumination conditions which makes the task of recognizing these faces extremely challenging.</b></p>

					<li><h3>Traffic Surveillance</h3></header></li> 
					<p><b>Vehicular transportation has been an integral part of human life since time immemorial.New  models  are  released  by the day and with increasingly smaller difference in the size and utility of the vehicle.  This makes image based classification of vehicles a major challenge in addressing ssues related to Intelligent Traffic Management such as vehicular density estimation, utility specific lane maintenance,load estimation, etc.</b></p>

					<li><h3>Cross Modal retrieval</h3></header></li> 
					<p><b> In recent years, cross-modal retrieval has drawn much attention due to the rapid growth of multimodal data. It takes one type of data as the query to retrieve relevant data of another type. For example, a user can use a text to retrieve relevant pictures or videos. Since the query and its retrieved results can be of different modalities, how to measure the content similarity between different modalities of data remains a challenge.</b></p>

					<!--<li> <header> <h3>Cross Modal Hashing</h3></header></li> 
					<p>Due to availability of large amounts of multimedia data,
						cross-modal matching is gaining increasing importance.
						Hashing based techniques provide an attractive solution to
						this problem when the data size is large. Different scenar-
						ios of cross-modal matching are possible, for example, data
						from the different modalities can be associated with a single label or multiple labels, and in addition may or may not have one-to-one correspondence. Most of the existing
						approaches have been developed for the case where there	is one-to-one correspondence between the data of the two modalities</p>
